<p>Each point represents one gene. Since simvastatin is a known lipid-lowering drug, simvastatin induced gene expression signature was predicted to reverse the S-PrediXcan estimated gene expression signature for hyperlipidemia (Weighted correlation = -0.32). The blue line indicates the expected negative correlation between S-PrediXcan estimated hyperlipidemia gene expression signature (horizontal axis) and iLINCS simvastatin induced gene expression signature (vertical axis). As expected, the <em>LDLR</em> gene (red point) was downregulated in patients (x-axis value = -4.57) with hyperlipidemia and upregulated in simvastatin perturbation experiments (y-axis value = 0.382). iLINCS: Integrative Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures.</p>
